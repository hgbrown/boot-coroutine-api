# SpringBoot Coroutine API demo

Demonstrates the use of Coroutine API to provide a non-blocking, asynchronous API for a Spring Boot application.

## Testcontainers support

This project
uses [Testcontainers at development time](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/3.2.0/reference/html/features.html#features.testing.testcontainers.at-development-time).

Testcontainers has been configured to use the following Docker images:

* [`postgres:latest`](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)

To run the demo using the TestContainer support for development, run the `main` function in
the `TestBootCoroutineApiApplication` class. This will start the Spring Boot application and the PostgreSQL database in
a Docker container.

The application is set up to use the `dev` profile by default which is only available in the `test` classpath.
Attempting to start the application from the `BootCoroutineApiApplication` class will fail since no `dev` profile
application properties are available.

To run the application in a non-dev environment requires the use of an alternative profile to be provided along with the
configuration properties for the PostgreSQL database.
